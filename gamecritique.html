								<span>However, there are plenty of situations that could make a lost die and fail that game level. For example, a lost can drown if he walks into water. A lost will also die if he walks into fire or walk into a sad Booey.</span>

								<span>At first, the game is pretty easy and straightforward to think about the solution. It only took seconds for me to solve the problem. And afterwards, the complexity increase along with the increase of game items with more complex rules to consider. And I think the game really got interesting only when more rules and game items appear, which make the game more challenging.</span>

								<span>However, even before the game has become really complex, without some better tutorials right before the game level, I overrated the difficulty degree of the third level: Can’t hurt to try.</span>
								<div class="project-image">
									<img class="materialboxed feature-image" data-caption="Set Weekly Tasks" src="images/gamecritique/level3rd.png">
								</div>
								<p>As the name said, I tried a lot of complex solution, any of which could not work. And meanwhile, the hint “can the lost walk through fire?” doesn’t change which means if I could not figure it out at first with the hint provided, I could not seek more help from the game once I am stuck. Cognitive bias is devastated, which made me trapped in my fixed thoughts about how this level should work. And after times of struggling, I gave up and searched for tutorial in Youtube. However, the solution turned out to be extremely simple… I don’t know what should I say to myself with such silly game performance.</p>
								<p>In the whole process of playing this game, I always feel like I am not getting enough prepared and guidance before many game levels, which led me wasting lots of time exploring different failures. I always have to try for several times with failures to become clearer of the right thing I should do and such failures are not caused by my wrong strategies to get the solutions.</p>

								<span>After getting through each level, the player will get a little certification of different skill sets, including problem solving, logic attention to detail and so on. However, as my personal experience of this game, I am kind of confused about the rules behind such certification of different skill sets, such as which behaviors of mine during the current level mapping to the certification I got after completing the game level. From perspectives of both a player and also a starter of educational game design, I think it would be better if the connection between skill sets achieved after each game level and game behaviors and solution in the level can be more explicit and meaningful, which may enhance the learning performance and decrease players’ confusion. Because, besides my own thinking during the game, when going through players’ reviews in Amazon, I also saw some other players have pointed out that they could not see how this game could benefit to their technical skills, algorithm skills and so on.</span>

								<span>The game uses a series of increasingly difficult puzzles to engage five aptitudes critical to technical careers:
									<ul>
										<li>1) Problem Solving</li>
										<li>2) Logic</li>
										<li>3) Attention to Detail: There will be small game items which need attention from players in order to pass the current level.</li>
										<li>4) Understanding Algorithms: Players need to utilize some parallel concepts of “if-then”, “while” and so on to come up with solution. For example, if the lost can view the fire light without blocks, it will start to move forwards.</li>
										<li>5) Building Solutions.</li>
									</ul>
									As players progress through the game’s 36 levels, they are gradually exposed to potential careers that utilize the same skills needed to complete each level. This exposure demonstrates the link between gameplay and future jobs in technology.

								<p>Players need to utilize the different game scenario setting and game items for different levels to let booey guide the lost to the portal successfully. There are basically three types of behaviors including:
									<ul>
										<li>1. Trigger the lost to move forward</li>
										<li>2. Guide the lost to avoid being killed by fire, sad Booeys and water.</li>
										<li>3. Design the path to lead the lost to the portal.</li>
									</ul>
									This is basically that part that is mostly related to the learning goals. Such mechanics create problems which need corresponding skills to solve.

From this synthesis make a final judgement about the educational potential of the game. It is perfectly fine to say you think a game is a poor example of an educational game, having some bad examples will help you to understand what makes something good.</div>
						<div class="contents">
							I am not talking about the failures in an educational game is meaningless. I just think that failures caused by unclear of the game rules and settings are quite unnecessary and frustrating for players. When you fail the game because of your confusion about the rules, you have no idea or expectation about how you can finally overcome your confusion and how many times you need to try before you get through this level. This is not the most frustrated part for me. The most disappointing experience of this for me is that I don’t know how I can fail more meaningfully, and which is the right direction for me to explore to make sure I am on the way of getting pass of this level without meaningless waste of time.
