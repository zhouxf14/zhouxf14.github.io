        <div class="work-subhead2">What is it?</div>
        <div class="text1">
          <p>This is a safe which can be <span class="highlight">shared with guests</span>. <span class="highlight">Different spaces</span> with different locks make the sharing possible. Facial recognition and speech recognition are used as its <span class="highlight">doublet code</span>. Once discovering <span class="highlight">unidentified users</span>, a spare empty space will be activated and the current user can only open that empty space, which is actually <span class="highlight">a fake space</span> and will protect valuable items in the safe.</p>
          <p>The idea of that "fake space" used to protect owner's possession when the safe is broken into came from <span class="highlight">a tiny magic box</span> I played in my childhood.</p>

          </div>
          <p style="padding-top: 10px;">I am the <span class="highlight">independent designer and developer</span> for this project. I designed the spatial model for product construction with SketchUp. The safe was developed with Python and Arduino programming on Galileo Board and ZOC Terminal.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="work-subhead2">What problems does it solve?</div>
        <div class="text1">
          <p>Safe is always a very secret and personal space for people. But <span class="highlight">differentiate the space</span> for it will provide opportunity to share such safe between the owner and guests when it is necessary, even can be "shared" safely with people who have <span class="highlight">bad intentions</span>.</p> 
        </div>
        <div class="work-subhead2">How does it work?</div>
        <div class="text1">
          <p>First, it will use <span class="highlight">face recognition</span> to decide whether the user is its owner or not. If the face and speech password are all verified, the <span class="highlight">owner’s space</span> will be open.</p>
          <p>But if the face is recognized as a guest(a stranger), the user will be asked about the <span class="highlight">speech password prepared for the guest</span>, which can prove that the user has been given the right of use by the owner.</p>
          <p>If unfortunately the user isn’t the owner, but also not an authorized guest, then the safe will indeed be open but only <span class="highlight">a reserved empty space</span> can be open. So nothing in the safe will be threatened by the unidentified user, who probably is a thief.</p>
