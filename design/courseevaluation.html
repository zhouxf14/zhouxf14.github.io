        <div class="work-subhead">What is it?</div>
        <div class="text1">
          <p>Ping(评什么) is the very first course online evaluation platform initiated by several undergraduates from Tsinghua University. On the platform, students can <span class="highlight">provide or search for the feedback</span> for the courses they have taken or plan to take. Also, <span class="highlight">the study experience</span> for a specific course can be shared and discussed on it.</p>
          <div class="center img">

          </div>
          <p style="padding-top: 10px;">I am the <span class="highlight"> UI designer</span> in our group. I worked hard to think about how to <span class="highlight">make it easier</span> for students to reach the information they really want and how to <span class="highlight">make it less trouble</span> for them to provide their own feedback for courses they have taken. I hope to provide better user experience for students to make them more willing to share their valuable information on this sharing platform.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="work-subhead">What problems does it solve?</div>
        <div class="text1"><p>At the end of each semester in Tsinghua University, it is the time for students to select courses they want to take for next term. In order to decide whether to take a course or not, students need to spend lots of energy looking for extra information of some truly important aspects of a course, including <span class="highlight">the curriculum quality</span>, <span class="highlight">the curriculum task quantity</span>, <span class="highlight">the professor's teaching style</span> and so on. As a result, students always spend a lot of time unnecessary seeking such information from other schoolmates who have already taken those courses. In turn, students may also have to talk about his or her experience in one course for several times, which is quite <span class="highlight">an inefficient</span> process. In addition, it it not easy to find someone who happens to have taken the courses, which means that it is quite <span class="highlight">an uneffective</span> process. That's how we came up with the idea to establish a course online evaluation platform to provide an opportunity for students to share more comprehensive and effective information of all the courses to our schoolmates.</p></div>
